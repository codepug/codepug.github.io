## Great Outdoors Screen Saver

This is a Win32 screen saver created when you want to add a touch of the outdoors to your desktop. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a digital camera that I could hold in my paws. Hope you enjoy my drawing of the great outdoors. You might even see a racoon walking around.
