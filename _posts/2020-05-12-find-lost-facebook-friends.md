## Find Lost Facebook Friends
Facebook is an awesome social networking web-site. Unfortunately, it doesn't alert users when they are removed from someone elses friends list. The find lost facebook friends application provides the ability to proactively track any friends that have removed you as a friend. This application is a definite must for those with over 100 friends who may have difficulty finding out which friends have been lost when their friend count is reduced. Enjoy!

### Notes
The first time the application is used, a window will pop-up allowing you to log into FaceBook and grant the appropriate privledges to the application. There are still some unpredicatable timing issues with the code. If things are not looking right or the Facebook login window stays open after successful authentication, try pressing the refresh button.
