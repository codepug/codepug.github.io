## {{ page.title }}

After the 2nd handle broke on my toilet, I decided that it was finally time to bring my 
toilet into the 21st century.  As more and more devices adopt Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
connectors, it was a quick decision to steer my toilet's human interface towards this same 
cable standard.

### Required Hardware
 * 1.5 foot or longer USB cable
 * 1 regular size safety pin
 * Scissors or wire cutter

### Steps Taken
 * Unscrew the existing side mount toilet handle tank flush lever and disconnect from the rubber flapper chain
 * Remove the connector from one end of the USB with the scissors or wire cutter
 * Thread the cable through the outer hole left from the tank flush lever that was removed leaving the larger USB connector end on the outside of the tank
 * Attach the saftey pin to both the cable and the chain to the rubber flapper.  You can either poke the pin through the cable's insulation or tie a knot around it with the cable.
 * Remove any extra cable length not needed so that the cable retracts back into the toilet after flushing is done.
 * Examine the completed solution to ensure that the rubber flapper is able to fall back into place to ensure a seal at the completion of each flush.

### Additional Notes
*These instructions are for entertainment only and any modifications to your toilet are at your own risk.  It is best to seek the advice of a licensed plumber. Please make sure that any changes made 
to your toilet do not cause water leaks.
