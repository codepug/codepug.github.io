## DIY Replica Google Glass

Did you ever want to impress your friends with a Google Glass, but didn't have the funds to procure them?  Since they are fairly new, creating a replica copy to wear around town isn't as difficult as you think it would be.  You can make modifications to the design here in anyway that you want, but here is an item list to get you started.

### Item List
  * Hair head band
  * Old pair of sunglasses
  * Thick plastic bottle
  * Milk jug
  * Hot glue

### Assembly Directions
  * Cut the nose supports off of an existing pair of cheap sunglasses
  * Tape or hot glue these to the hair headband nearest the center of the inner part of the curve
  * Cut the handle off of a milk jug in a fashion that reveals a slight L shape
  * Add a small tiny circle using black tape or marker for where the camera would be
  * Hot glue or tape the milk jug handle onto the right side of the head band

That's all there is to it!  I wore these to work the day after I built them.  I got a lot of looks from everyone I passed in the hall.  I could feel that a great number of people were envious, while others wanted to see them up close.  Enjoy!
