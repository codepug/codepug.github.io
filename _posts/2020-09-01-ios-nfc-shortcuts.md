### NFC Lego Dimensions with Your iPhone Shortcuts
As I was walking around my basement, I recently stumbled upon some [Lego Dimensions](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lego+dimensions&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) pieces.  Curious about it, I wondered if it used Near Field Communication (NFC) tags so I pulled out my phone and tried to add a NFC automation trigger in the Shortcuts app.  It worked!

The Lego Dimension NFC tags can trigger an automation shortcut to do things like have your phone say something out loud, play a song, send a text, or even call someone.  It's up to your imagination!

### Steps to Setup

Open the Shortcuts app on your device, and follow the following steps:
 1. Tap on the automation tab
 1. Tap on the ***Create Personal Automation*** button
 1. Tap on NFC
 1. Tap on Scan and then scan your NFC tag giving it a name
 1. Search and add ***Speak Text***
 1. Toggle the ***Ask Before Running*** switch and tap ***Don't Ask***
 1. After tapping done, touch the NFC tag with the top of your phone to test

### Additional Notes
I did find that the screen had to be on in order to scan the NFC tag.  However, the phone didn't have to be unlocked for it to work.
