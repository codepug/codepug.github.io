## Squirrel Fishing: a Modern Pastime

Squirrel fishing is both fun and exciting! A while back, I was fortunate enough to have been able to capture some of the experiences of some squirrel fishermen on my camera. This event occurred on the quad at Illinois State University.

After I took these shots, I asked the squirrel fishermen a few questions. The first was about the safety of the squirrels. They responded that they have taken all possible precautions in ensuring the safety of the squirrels. No hooks are used at all. In fact, the fishing pole is optional. All that is needed is a string tied around a fresh unsalted peanut. My other question is how they first heard about squirrel fishing. They both replied that they heard about it from friends and on the web.

During my interview and observations of the squirrel fishermen, the sport of squirrel fishing has earned my respect. Although there is a lot of knowledge and skill to be gained to be competitive, squirrel fishing can be great fun even for novices. I salute you squirrel fishermen for giving us the inspiration to drop a few peanuts onto a string.
