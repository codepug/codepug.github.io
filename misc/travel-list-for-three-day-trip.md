## Travel List for Three Day Trip
If you are anyone like me, you also find it more difficult than it should be to pack the items that you need to take on short trips.  Once there, I find myself scratching my head wondering why I didn't bring something as simple as a toothbrush with me all too often.  In order to ease the amount of planning that I have to do prior to each trip, I have arranged the following list of items that I find handy to have had packed.
